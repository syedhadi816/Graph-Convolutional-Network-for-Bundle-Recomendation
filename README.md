Existing recommendation systems in online educational
sites recommend individual courses to users, based
on their course history. However no system exists that recommends
bundles of courses to users following a sequential
order. In this project, we propose a recommender system
that generates bundles of courses to users of online learning
sites based on the preferences of similar users and previously
existing interactions. The system makes sure to recommend
a bundle that consists of courses from different streams (e.g
Chemistry, Media, Tourism etc.) and also take into consideration
the difficulty level and order of these courses. Using feature
engineering and collaborative filtering techniques, similarities
are established between users and their preferences generated.
Probability distributions are then used to rank courses and
subsequently generate bundles for each user separately for a
given snapshot of the weighted interactionsâ€™ bipartite graph.
